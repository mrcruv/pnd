One router with one lan with 2 pcs. The assignment is: to
configure the topology to use dynamic IPv6 addresses.
 
You have to use SLAAC+DHCPv6 to provide GUA addresses to the 
machines in the lan. It is a stateless dynamic addressing.
You have to properly set up the addresses of r1 and dnmasq
and to properly set up the pc configurations.

- lan has the subnet 2001:DB8:FEDE:1::/64 and 192.168.100.0/24
- you can also setup the domain name (es: netsec.local)
- r1 uses as DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 2001:4860:4860::8888
 
- pc1 and pc2 must obtain the address via SLAAC and the DNS+domain
  info via stateless DHCPv6

- pc1 has to use dibbler-client
  -- you can install it using dpkg -i /shared/dibbler-client*

- pc2 has to use dhclient 

- the router has always 1 in the host part of its own address 
  even in its local-link address.
