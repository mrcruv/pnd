Two hosts connected to two different wans. You have to configure IPsec
between the two hosts. You have to use IPv6.
They have the the following IPv6 address scheme:
- r1 and r2 have fd00:cafe:0:1::100/64 and fd00:cafe:0:2::100/64 respectively
- isp has fd00:cafe:0:1::1/64  and fd00:cafe:0:2::1/64 

Setup IPsec with AH and ESP with a preshared key using setkey
