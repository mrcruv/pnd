Two routers connecting via wan and with two lans. Setup a tunnel between the
two lans using the racoon daemon for the SA negotiation.

Setup the two lans to have the following IPv4 scheme:
- lanA: 192.168.1.0/24 (r1 has .1)
- lanB: 192.168.2.0/24 (r2 has .1)
- r1 and r2 have 100.60.0.2/16 and 100.90.0.2/16 respectively
- isp has 100.60.0.1 and 100.90.0.1

Setup the IPsec tunnel between r1 and r2 and enable the use of the tunnel
when connecting the traffic between the two lans.
