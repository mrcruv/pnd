Two hosts connected to two different wans. You have to configure IPsec
between the two hosts.
They have the the following IPv4 scheme:
- r1 and r2 have 100.60.0.100/16 and 100.90.0.100/16 respectively
- isp has 100.60.0.1/16 and 100.90.0.1/16

Setup IPsec with AH and ESP with a preshared key, using setkey.
