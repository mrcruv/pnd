A lan with a host, a server and a router. Can you join the network
and eavesdrop the traffic? 
The assignment is to create a virtual interface in the hosting
machine and join the internal network A. This can be done in several
ways (using the bridge interface or creating a virtual interface to
be joined to the actual bridge).
Once done sniff the traffic.
